# Introduction

This project is a re-design of a pet clinic website. It is the live version of work done for the course <strong>C773, User Interface Design</strong>, at <strong>Western Governor's University</strong>. 

The course guides students through the process of designing a user interface, including: discussing stakeholder and audience needs, developing website architecture, designing a wireframe, and producing a working prototype of said wireframe with responsive web design in mind. 

You can view the original UI specifications for the project <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ea3lvtp52xgbx9z/Paradigm%20Pet%20Professionals%20UI%20Design%20Specifications.pdf?dl=0">here</a>, the original website <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jr3oiwsvhnlmqgx/paradigm-original.pdf?dl=0">here</a>, my proposals for improvements <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2gfjit5hnzhv9er/Amanda_Hayes_C773_Task_1_Proposals.pdf?dl=0">here</a>, and the wireframe <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/QrX2gA5NGDvNuQHby4sUgT/c773?node-id=67%3A1419&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=67%3A1419">here</a>.

## Common Errors

> `npm install react-scripts --save`

Then type:

> `npm install`

Then press enter, and the program should open in your browser.

## Open Ports

Closing the port when you are no longer using it is important to your computer's security. Closing the port will also ensure that the port is available when you want to run other projects on that port.

To close Port 3000, open your terminal and enter the following code:

> npx kill-port 3000
